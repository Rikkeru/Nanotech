Status of Nanotechnology in the Philippines
The potential of nanotechnology has been acknowledged by the Philippines, as 
such a technology roadmap was established 10 years ago to guide the development of 
nanotechnology in the country. However, the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
drastically affected the timeline of most technological roadmaps. Several barriers and 
constraints for the adoption of nanotechnology in the Philippines were identified. On the 
other hand, the facilitating factors that would enable the acceptance of the technology 
in the country was also explored. Moreover, the impacts brought about by the 
advancements in nanotechnology towards major sectors such as the economy, 
environment, and society were also discussed. From the gathered information on the 
trends, factors for adoption and impacts of the technology, policy recommendations 
were raised to help establish the roots of nanotechnology in the country and support it in 
its technological maturity.
In the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council 
for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development Council (DOSTPCASTRD) fronted extensive R&D initiatives for nanotechnology in the country by launching 
a 10-year strategic roadmap, crafted by a group of interdisciplinary local scientists in 2009.
