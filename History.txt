History of Nanotechnology
4th Century: The Lycurgus Cup (Rome) is an example of dichroic glass; colloidal 
gold and silver in the glass allow it to look opaque green when lit from outside but 
translucent red when light shines through the inside.
9th-17th Centuries: Glowing, glittering “luster” ceramic glazes used in the Islamic 
world, and later in Europe, contained silver or copper or other metallic nanoparticles.
6th-15th Centuries: Vibrant stained-glass windows in European cathedrals owed 
their rich colors to nanoparticles of gold chloride and other metal oxides and chlorides; 
gold nanoparticles also acted as photocatalytic air purifiers.
13th-18th Centuries: “Damascus” saber blades contained carbon nanotubes and 
cementite nanowires an ultrahigh-carbon steel formulation that gave them strength, 
resilience, the ability to hold a keen edge, and a visible moiré pattern in the steel that give 
the blades their name.
1857: Michael Faraday discovered colloidal “ruby” gold, demonstrating that 
nanostructured gold under certain lighting conditions produces different-colored solutions.
1936: Erwin Müller, working at Siemens Research Laboratory, invented the field 
emission microscope, allowing near-atomic-resolution images of materials.
1947: John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs discovered 
the semiconductor transistor and greatly expanded scientific knowledge of 
semiconductor interfaces, laying the foundation for electronic devices and the 
Information Age.
1951: Erwin Müller pioneered the field ion microscope, a means to image the 
arrangement of atoms at the surface of a sharp metal tip; he first imaged tungsten atoms.
1981: Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM’s Zurich lab invented the scanning 
tunneling microscope, allowing scientists to "see" (create direct spatial images of) 
individual atoms for the first time. Binnig and Rohrer won the Nobel Prize for this discovery 
in 1986.
1985: Rice University researchers Harold Kroto, Sean O’Brien, Robert Curl, and 
Richard Smalley discovered the Buckminsterfullerene (C60), more commonly known as the 
buckyball, which is a molecule resembling a soccer ball in shape and composed entirely 
of carbon, as are graphite and diamond. The team was awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for their roles in this discovery and that of the fullerene class of molecules more 
generally.
1985: Bell Labs’s Louis Brus discovered colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals 
(quantum dots), for which he shared the 2008 Kavli Prize in Nanotechnology.
1986: Gerd Binnig, Calvin Quate, and Christoph Gerber invented the atomic force 
microscope, which has the capability to view, measure, and manipulate materials down 
to fractions of a nanometer in size, including measurement of various forces intrinsic to 
nanomaterials.
1989: Don Eigler and Erhard Schweizer at IBM's Almaden Research Center 
manipulated 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the IBM logo. This demonstration of the 
ability to precisely manipulate atoms ushered in the applied use of nanotechnology.
1991: Sumio Iijima of NEC is credited with discovering the carbon nanotube (CNT), 
although there were early observations of tubular carbon structures by others as well. Iijima 
shared the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience in 2008 for this advance and other advances in the 
field. CNTs, like buckyballs, are entirely composed of carbon, but in a tubular shape. They 
exhibit extraordinary properties in terms of strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, 
among others.
1992: C.T. Kresge and colleagues at Mobil Oil discovered the nanostructured
catalytic materials MCM-41 and MCM-48, now used heavily in refining crude oil as well as 
for drug delivery, water treatment, and other varied applications.
1999: Cornell University researchers Wilson Ho and Hyojune Lee probed secrets of 
chemical bonding by assembling a molecule [iron carbonyl Fe(CO)2] from constituent 
components [iron (Fe) and carbon monoxide (CO)] with a scanning tunneling 
microscope.
1999: Chad Mirkin at Northwestern University invented dip-pen nanolithography 
(DPN), leading to manufacturable, reproducible “writing” of electronic circuits as well as 
patterning of biomaterials for cell biology research, nanoencryption, and other 
applications. 
1999–early 2000’s: Consumer products making use of nanotechnology began 
appearing in the marketplace, including lightweight nanotechnology-enabled 
automobile bumpers that resist denting and scratching, golf balls that fly straighter, tennis 
rackets that are stiffer (therefore, the ball rebounds faster), baseball bats with better flex 
and "kick," nano-silver antibacterial socks, clear sunscreens, wrinkle- and stain-resistant 
clothing, deep-penetrating therapeutic cosmetics, scratch-resistant glass coatings, fasterrecharging batteries for cordless electric tools, and improved displays for televisions, cell 
phones, and digital cameras.
