Summary
To summarize, nanotechnology is a field of science and engineering that focuses 
on manipulating atoms and molecules at the nanoscale to design, produce, and use 
structures, devices, and systems. While there have always been natural examples of 
structures with nanoscale dimensions, intentional manipulation of nanoscale structures has 
become possible only in recent years. Nanotechnology offers the potential for significant 
advancements in various industries by harnessing the unique properties and behavior of 
materials at the nanoscale. It holds immense potential specially for transforming various 
industries and addressing societal needs through the development of advanced 
materials, devices, and systems at the nanoscale. Ongoing research and innovation in this 
field continue to drive new discoveries and practical applications with far-reaching 
implications
