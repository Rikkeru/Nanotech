Presentation of Nanotechnology
Uses and Functions
The main goal of nanotechnology is to develop new substances, machines, and 
systems with special qualities and capabilities resulting from their tiny architectures. The 
following are some of the primary uses and applications of nanotechnology:
• Electronics and Computing: Nanotechnology has had a significant impact 
on electronics and computing. It has led to the development of smaller, 
faster, and more efficient electronic components, such as transistors, 
memory devices, and sensors. Nanoscale materials, such as carbon 
nanotubes and graphene, have unique electrical properties and are being 
explored for use in future generations of electronics.
• Energy: Nanotechnology is being used to improve energy production, 
storage, and efficiency. For example, nanomaterials are being explored for 
more efficient solar cells and energy storage devices, such as batteries and 
supercapacitors. Nanotechnology is also applied in developing more 
efficient catalysts for fuel cells and improving the energy efficiency of 
buildings.
• Biomedicine: The properties of some nanomaterials make them ideal for 
improving early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or 
cancer. They are able to attack cancer cells selectively without harming 
other healthy cells. Some nanoparticles have also been used to enhance 
pharmaceutical products such as sunscreen.
• Environment: Air purification with ions, wastewater purification with 
nanobubbles or nanofiltration systems for heavy metals are some of its 
environmentally-friendly applications. Nanocatalysts are also available to 
make chemical reactions more efficient and less polluting.
• Food: In this field, nanobiosensors could be used to detect the presence of 
pathogens in food or nanocomposites to improve food production by 
increasing mechanical and thermal resistance and decreasing oxygen 
transfer in packaged products.
• Textile: Nanotechnology makes it possible to develop smart fabrics that 
don't stain nor wrinkle, as well as stronger, lighter and more durable 
materials to make motorcycle helmets or sports equipment.
Importance and Benefits
The impact of nanotechnology extends from its medical, ethical, mental, and 
environmental applications to fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, computing, 
materials science, and communications. Major benefits of nanotechnology include 
improved manufacturing methods, water purification systems, energy systems, physical 
enhancement, nanomedicine, better food production methods, nutrition and large-scale 
infrastructure auto-fabrication. Nanotechnology's reduced size may allow for automation 
of tasks which were previously inaccessible due to physical restrictions, which in turn may 
reduce labor, land, or maintenance requirements placed on humans.
• Medical- Nanotechnology has extensive application as nanomedicine in the 
medical field. Some nanoparticles have possible applications in novel 
diagnostic instruments, imagery and methodologies, targeted medicinal 
products, pharmaceutical products, biomedical implants, and tissue 
engineering. Today treatments of high toxicity can be administered with 
improved safety using nanotechnology, such as chemotherapeutic cancer 
drugs.
• Ethical- Considering the significant risks associated with nanotechnology, it is 
crucial to thoroughly evaluate its potential repercussions. While it is possible that 
nanotechnology may not reach the level of advancement anticipated by its 
proponents, it is prudent to proactively address any ethical concerns that may 
arise before the technology becomes firmly established in society.
• Mental- Nanotechnology can potentially have both positive and negative 
impacts on mental health. On the positive side, nanotechnology-based 
advancements in diagnostics and treatment options can lead to more 
effective and personalized approaches for mental health disorders. However, 
it is essential to consider the potential risks and ethical implications associated 
with nanotechnology. The use of nanomaterials in brain interfaces or implants 
raises concerns regarding long-term safety, privacy, and the potential for 
unintended consequences.
• Environmental- The environmental impact of nanotechnology is the possible 
effects that the use of nanotechnological materials and devices will have on 
the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is debate 
regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of nanomaterials will 
affect organisms and ecosystems. Nanotechnology's environmental impact 
can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations 
to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that 
nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment.
Literature Reviews and Supporting Information
Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that includes a vast and diverse array of 
devices that derived from engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology leading to the 
development of structures, devices and systems that have novel functional properties by 
size ranging between 1 and 100 nm (Neethirajan and Jayas 2010; Borm et al, 2006; Ducan 
2011). Nanotechnology involves the manipulation of materials at nanometer sizes leading 
to the fabrication of nanodevices to enhance their performance.
APPLICATIONS OF NANOPARTICLES
• Nanomaterials – used to describe materials with one or more components that 
have at least one dimension in the range of 1 to 100 nm and include Nanoparticles, 
nanofibres and nanotubes, composite materials and nano-structured surfaces. 
These include Nanoparticles (NP) as a subset of nanomaterials currently defined 
by consensus as single particles with a diameter < 100 nm. Agglomerates of NP can 
be larger than 100 nm in diameter but will be included in the discussion since they 
may break down on weak mechanical forces or in solvents. Nanofibres are a subclass of nanoparticles (include nanotubes) which have two dimensions < 100 nm 
but the third (axial) dimension can be much larger. 
• Nanotools – tools and techniques for synthesizing nanomaterials, manipulating 
atoms and fabricating device structures, and very importantly for measuring and 
characterizing materials and devices at the nanoscale.
• Nanodevices – making devices at the nanoscale, important in microelectronics 
and optoelectronics at the present time, and at the interface with biotechnology 
where the aim is to mimic the action of biological systems such as cellular motors. 
This latter area is the most futuristic, and excites the greatest public reaction (Borm 
et al., 2006)
Technology Observations
This technological branch manipulates the molecular structure of materials to 
change their intrinsic properties and obtain others with revolutionary applications. This is 
the case of graphene — modified carbon harder than steel, lighter than aluminum and 
almost transparent — or nanoparticles used in areas such as electronics, energy, 
biomedicine or defense. There are bright and dark spots in the future of nanotechnology. 
On the one hand, the sector is expected to grow globally, driven by technological 
advances, increased government support, increased private investment and growing 
demand for smaller devices, to name a few. However, the environmental, health and 
safety risks of nanotechnology and concerns related to its commercialization could 
hamper market expansion. Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a nearatomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises 
scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer products, energy, 
materials and manufacturing.
Surveys and Technology Evaluation
In 2005, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded a grant to the National 
Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) to poll over 6,000 senior-level executives in 
leading U.S. organizations with leadership, technology or strategic research and 
development (R&D) responsibility to assess the outcome of growing private and public 
investments made in nano-technology under the National Nanotechnology Initiative 
(NNI). The overarching objective in conducting this largest known cross-industry 
benchmark study was to determine whether surveyed organizations treat nanotechnology 
differently from any other generation of advanced science and technology. The metric 
established by NSF was 300 survey responses to develop a credible profile – the survey 
netted 594 completed responses, representing a response rate of 10%. The NCMS survey 
of nearly 600 industry executives indicates that the state of the U.S. Nanomanufacturing 
Industry is generally vital, innovative and competitive for demonstrated passive 
nanotechnology products with many two-dimensional (2D) product applications growing 
rapidly for end-uses across diverse industry sectors. The survey confirms that the U.S. has 
the best-developed and mature research facilities, entrepreneurial culture and 
governance infrastructure for promoting new nanotechnology driven economic 
development.
